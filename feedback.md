"I know how to sew, but  knew very little about circuits so I almost did not attend.  Glad I did.  Molly did a great job educating those of us without that background. I really enjoyed seeing the creativity attendees had in designing and applying the circuit to their materials."

"I think this course was very well organized and presented. However, I would be interested in either a part II to this course or a more advanced option for anyone who already has some sewing and programming skills. Obviously I completely understand need to an intro/basics course but one that got a bit more into some of the fancier things that can be done with sewables would be great!"

"I would have been glad to spend more time in the class so we could learn more about the options (stickers, strips) and seeing more of what other people had done. In other words - a bigger picture then just our project."

"Add moving objects, like arduino projects."

"If possible additional working samples that shows what is possible, ranging from program different blink patterns, etc... "

"Awesome work, and it was tons of fun!"
