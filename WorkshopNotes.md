#Notes for the running the workshop

##Overview
There are many ways to have a successful Sewable Circuits workshop. These are some tips and tricks I learned from running mine - feel free to take what works for you and ignore the rest!

There are kind of two sections to the workshop:
1. Sewing / Introduction to Circuits
2. Programming

It's very difficult to do them both in one workshop, so I recommend splitting them up.

##Confirm in advance
1. Big monitor to display slides (ask if it's compatible with your system, and arrive early to test)
2. Internet connection (slides are hosted online, folks may need to download and install things there, and you may want to skype call yourself in order to display things on the screen).
3. Microphone / sound system if you need it.

##Troubleshooting
There are really three main mistakes I've seen people make.

####Shorting out thread
This is the most dangerous. If you take the thread that's connected to V+ and touch it to the thread that's connected to GND, you'll get a short. That short will very quickly start smoking and could actually start a fire. That's why I ALWAYS tell people (and remind them!) to turn off their gemma while sewing. They need to treat the thread like it is bare wire, because that's exactly what it is. It's easy to forget a dangling end, so also trim the ends super short!

####Not cutting the thread between "paths".
